 Step 1: Start the hub

	The Hub is the central point that will receive all the test request and distribute them the the right nodes.

	Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone file. Type the following command:


		java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role hub


	The hub will automatically start-up using port 4444 by default.
	To change the default port, you can add the optional parameter -port when you run the command.
	You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to: http://localhost:4444/grid/console

Step 2: Start the nodes

	You use the same selenium-server-standalone jar file to start the nodes.


		java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role node  -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register


	Note: The port defaults to 5555 if not specified whenever the "-role" option is provided and is not hub.

	For backwards compatibility "wd" and "rc" roles are still a valid subset of the "node" role.
	But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while "node" allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections. 

Call from C#

	DesiredCapabilities capability = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
	WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), capability);
